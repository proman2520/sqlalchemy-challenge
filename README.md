# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this repository, the Resources folder contains the starter data, including hawaii_measurements.csv, 
hawaii_stations.csv, and the hawaii.sqlite file. There is also this README file, the climate_starter.ipynb, 
which provided an outline to compare my outputs against, climate_main.ipynb, which contains my own code to 
replicate the desired outputs, and app.py, which runs the Flask API and contains my code to define the 
pathways.

Regarding help from other places, I mostly referenced the class activity solutions (the Zoom recordings 
have not yet been posted). I consulted AskBCS 3 times, all regarding confusion over the Flask code. Two 
times my code was debugged, and the third time was simply a misreading of the rubric/instructions.

The rubric is complicated, so if I am not able to get full points, please let me know where I missed the 
objectives. I intend to fix any errors. Thank you for your time grading my assignment.

Best,
Andrew Prozorovsky
